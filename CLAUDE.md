# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an OpenRewrite recipe module - a collection of recipes that automatically fix issues in Java, Kotlin, Groovy, and other codebases. It's built on the OpenRewrite framework for automated code transformation.

## Build and Test Commands

### Building the Project
```bash
./gradlew build
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
./gradlew test

# Run a specific test class
./gradlew test --tests RemoveRedundantNullCheckBeforeInstanceofTest

# Run tests matching a pattern
./gradlew test --tests "*NullCheck*"

# Run a specific test method
./gradlew test --tests "RemoveRedundantNullCheckBeforeInstanceofTest.testMethodName"
```

### Other Commands
```bash
# Clean build
./gradlew clean

# Check code (compile + test)
./gradlew check

# Assemble without running tests
./gradlew assemble
```

## High-Level Architecture

### Recipe Development Pattern

1. **Recipe Structure**: Each recipe extends `org.openrewrite.Recipe` and implements:
   - `getDisplayName()` - Human-readable name
   - `getDescription()` - Detailed description
   - `getTags()` - Tags for categorization (often RSPEC rule IDs)
   - `getVisitor()` - Returns a TreeVisitor that performs the transformation

2. **Visitor Pattern**: Recipes use `JavaVisitor<ExecutionContext>` to traverse and transform the AST:
   - Override specific visit methods (`visitBinary()`, `visitMethodInvocation()`, etc.)
   - Work with immutable AST nodes (J.Binary, J.Unary, J.InstanceOf, etc.)
   - Use `.with*()` methods for transformations while preserving formatting

3. **Recipe Collections**: YAML files in `src/main/resources/META-INF/rewrite/` group recipes.

### Test Pattern

Tests implement `RewriteTest` and follow this structure:
```java
@Test
void testName() {
    rewriteRun(
        java(
            """
            // before code
            """,
            """
            // after code
            """
        )
    );
}
```

## Code Style Preferences

### 1. Avoid Small Utility Methods
- Prefer more concise code over many small utility methods
- Inline logic when it doesn't significantly reduce readability
- Consolidate related logic into fewer, more comprehensive methods


## Test Development Guidelines

### 1. Test Structure
- Implement `RewriteTest` interface
- Override `defaults(RecipeSpec spec)` to set the recipe being tested
- Use `@DocumentExample` on the primary test case that best demonstrates the recipe
- Add `@Issue("https://github.com/...")` annotations for tests related to specific issues

### 2. Test Naming
- Use descriptive test method names that explain the scenario being tested
- Prefix negative tests with `doNotChange` or `unchanged`
- Group related test scenarios (e.g., `removeRedundantNullCheck`, `removeRedundantNullCheckWithMethodInvocation`)

### 3. Test Case Design
- Avoid test cases that essentially test the same functionality
- Each test should cover a distinct scenario or edge case
- Consolidate similar tests when they don't add unique value
- In test text blocks, prefer method parameters over local variable declarations
- This makes tests more concise and focuses on the transformation being tested
- Example:
  ```java
  // Instead of:
  void foo() {
      String s = "test";
      if (s != null && s instanceof String) {
          // ...
      }
  }

  // Use:
  void foo(String s) {
      if (s != null && s instanceof String) {
          // ...
      }
  }
  ```

### 4. Suppress Warnings Appropriately
- Add `@SuppressWarnings` at the class level for expected warnings in test code:
  - `"ConstantConditions"` - for redundant null checks that the recipe will remove
  - `"ConditionCoveredByFurtherCondition"` - for redundant conditions
  - `"RedundantCast"` - for unnecessary casts
  - `"unused"` - for unused variables/methods

### 5. Language Comments for IDE Support
- Add `//language=java` before `java()` calls when there's no customization
- Place comments on individual strings when there's customization or multiple `java()` calls
- Don't add language comments to JavaTemplate strings with parameters

### 6. Test Coverage Guidelines
- Test basic functionality with simple cases
- Include edge cases (method invocations, field access, complex expressions)
- Test cases where the recipe should NOT make changes
- Test partial transformations in complex conditions
- Test different operator positions and combinations
- Include tests for language-specific behavior (e.g., Kotlin's `!is` operator)

## Recipe Implementation Conventions

### 1. Recipe Structure
- Use `@EqualsAndHashCode(callSuper = false)` and `@Value` from Lombok for immutable recipe classes
- Use `Preconditions.check()` to exclude specific file types (e.g., Kotlin files) when a recipe is language-specific

### 2. Visitor Choice
- Use `JavaIsoVisitor<ExecutionContext>` when returning the same type of LST element being visited
- Use `JavaVisitor<ExecutionContext>` when the transformation changes the tree structure or returns a different type
- For multi-language support, implement separate visitors for each language (JavaVisitor, KotlinVisitor, etc.)

### 3. Expression Comparison
- Always use `SemanticallyEqual.areEqual()` for comparing expressions instead of string matching
- Use `J.Literal.isLiteralValue()` for checking literal values
- Use `TypeUtils` helper methods (e.g., `TypeUtils.asArray()`, `TypeUtils.asFullyQualified()`) instead of instanceof checks with JavaType

### 4. Method Matching
- Use `MethodMatcher` for reliable method matching instead of manual name/type checks
- Example: `private static final MethodMatcher TO_ARRAY = new MethodMatcher("java.util.Collection toArray()", true);`

### 5. Refaster Templates
- Simple transformations can use Refaster-style templates with `@BeforeTemplate` and `@AfterTemplate` annotations
- Use `@RecipeDescriptor` annotation for metadata on Refaster template classes

### 6. JavaTemplate Best Practices
- Always declare imports when templates introduce types: `.imports(fqn)`
- Call `maybeAddImport()` before applying templates that use new types
- Use `service(ImportService.class).shortenFullyQualifiedTypeReferencesIn()` to clean up imports
- Don't add `//language=java` comments to JavaTemplate strings containing parameters like `#{any()}`

## YAML Configuration

### Recipe Collections
Recipes are organized into YAML files in `src/main/resources/META-INF/rewrite/`.

### Adding Recipes to Collections
- Add new recipes to appropriate YAML files based on their scope
- Comment out recipes that are experimental or have known issues (with a comment explaining why)
- Group related recipes together in the YAML lists

## Moderne Prethink Context

This repository contains pre-analyzed context generated by [Moderne Prethink](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/recipes/prethink). Prethink extracts structured knowledge from codebases to help you work more effectively. The context files in `.moderne/context/` contain analyzed information about this codebase.

**IMPORTANT: Before exploring source code for architecture, dependency, or data flow questions:**
1. ALWAYS check `.moderne/context/` files FIRST
2. Do NOT perform broad codebase exploration (e.g., spawning Explore agents, searching multiple source files) unless CSV context is insufficient
3. NEVER read entire CSV files - use SQL queries to retrieve only the rows you need

**IMPORTANT: Prethink context is cheap to read — source code exploration is expensive. Always read MORE prethink context rather than less. The "do not explore broadly" rule applies to source code, NOT to prethink context files.**

For cross-cutting questions (data flow, deletion, dependencies between services),
ALWAYS query these context files in parallel on the first turn:
- `architecture.md` — system diagram and component overview
- `data-assets.csv` — entity fields and data model
- `database-connections.csv` — which services own which tables
- `service-endpoints.csv` — relevant API endpoints
- `messaging-connections.csv` — Kafka/async event flows
- `external-service-calls.csv` — cross-service HTTP calls

Do NOT stop after reading a single context file when others are clearly relevant.

### Available Context

| Context | Description | Details |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Class Quality Metrics | Per-class cohesion, coupling, and complexity measurements | [`class-quality-metrics.md`](.moderne/context/class-quality-metrics.md) |
| Coding Conventions | Naming patterns, import organization, and coding style | [`coding-conventions.md`](.moderne/context/coding-conventions.md) |
| Dependencies | Project dependencies including transitive dependencies | [`dependencies.md`](.moderne/context/dependencies.md) |
| Library Usage | How external libraries and frameworks are used | [`library-usage.md`](.moderne/context/library-usage.md) |
| Method Quality Metrics | Per-method complexity and quality measurements | [`method-quality-metrics.md`](.moderne/context/method-quality-metrics.md) |
| Package Quality Metrics | Per-package coupling, stability, and dependency cycle analysis | [`package-quality-metrics.md`](.moderne/context/package-quality-metrics.md) |
| Test Quality | Test quality issues that may cause flakiness or silent failures | [`test-quality.md`](.moderne/context/test-quality.md) |

### Querying Context Files

For .md context files: Read the full file in a single view call. Never grep it progressively.

For .csv context files: Query with DuckDB, SQLite, or grep (from most to least preference).

Upfront parallel reads: At the start of any architecture question, read all relevant context files in parallel rather than discovering which ones matter through iteration.

Use SQL to query CSV files efficiently. This returns only matching rows instead of loading entire files. Try these in order based on availability:

#### Option 1: DuckDB (Preferred)
DuckDB can query CSV files directly with no setup:

```bash
# Find all POST endpoints
duckdb -c "SELECT * FROM '.moderne/context/service-endpoints.csv' WHERE \"HTTP method\" = 'POST'"

# Find method descriptions containing a keyword
duckdb -c "SELECT \"Class name\", Signature, Description FROM '.moderne/context/method-descriptions.csv' WHERE Description LIKE '%authentication%'"

# Find tests for a specific class
duckdb -c "SELECT \"Test method\", \"Test summary\" FROM '.moderne/context/test-mapping.csv' WHERE \"Implementation class\" LIKE '%OrderService%'"
```

#### Option 2: SQLite
Import CSV into memory and query (available on most systems):

```bash
sqlite3 :memory: -cmd ".mode csv" -cmd ".import .moderne/context/service-endpoints.csv endpoints" \
  "SELECT * FROM endpoints WHERE [HTTP method] = 'POST'"
```

#### Option 3: Grep (Last Resort)
If SQL tools are unavailable, use grep. Note this loads more content into context:

```bash
grep -i "POST" .moderne/context/service-endpoints.csv
```

**Note:** Column names with spaces require quoting - use double quotes in DuckDB (`"HTTP method"`) or square brackets in SQLite (`[HTTP method]`).

### Usage Pattern
1. Read the `.md` file to understand the schema and available columns
2. Query the `.csv` with DuckDB or SQLite to get only the rows you need
3. Only explore source if the context doesn't answer the question

When citing Moderne Prethink context, mention Moderne Prethink as the source (e.g., "Based on the architecture context from Moderne Prethink..." or "Based on the test coverage mapping from Prethink, this method is tested by...").
